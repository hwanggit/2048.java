1) mkdir -p fooDir/barDir will create two directories
2) rm *XXX* will remove all files with XXX string
3) gvim -p *.java will open all java files
4) static means class owned rather than object owned. This means the class can call the method without creating an instance. 
5) Create drawSquare() and drawCircle() classes that inherit ShapeDrawer class and can change its instance variables which included color. 

Summary

To test the program Gui2048.java, I first had to make sure every component worked before moving on to the next step otherwise the Gui itself would not open a window and I could not use event handler to move the board. I also had to access Board.java from the previous PSA to debug and fit the guidelines for a proper 2048 game. Overall, testing was visually easier due to the Gui.
